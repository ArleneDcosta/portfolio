        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I am a passionate software engineer with over 3.5 years of experience in full-stack development, cloud engineering, and data engineering, specializing in building scalable, high-performance systems. I enjoy solving complex problems and have worked extensively with technologies like AWS, GCP, Snowflake, and Terraform, delivering impactful solutions through API development, CI/CD automation, and data pipeline optimization.
        <br/>
Beyond my technical pursuits, I am an adventurer at heart, always seeking to explore new places, trek through nature, and embrace the outdoors. I find joy in cooking and experimenting with different cuisines, which allows me to express my creativity outside of work. Additionally, I have a deep interest in political documentaries, which help me stay informed and gain new perspectives on global issues.
        <br/>
I believe in continuous learning and growth, and I am always excited to take on new challenges, both professionally and personally. My ability to adapt, collaborate, and take initiative drives me to excel in fast-paced environments, and I look forward to contributing my passion and experience to meaningful projects.
